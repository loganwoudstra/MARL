# Similarly, we register the layout that we want to use for the environment.
# We have an ascii-based design option, but you can also use a function to
# design, e.g., dynamically generated layouts.
# Each character represents an object that we've defined and registered with CoGrid:
#
#   C -> Counter. An impassable wall but items can be placed on and picked up from it.
#   @ -> Deliver Zone. Cooked dishes can be dopped here to be delivered.
#   = -> Stack of dishes. Agents can pick up from the (unlimited) dish stack to plate cooked onions.
#   O -> Pile of onions. Agents can pick up from the (unlimited) onion pile.
#   U -> Cooking pot. After placing three onions in the pot, they'll cook and can be plated.
#   # -> Walls. Walls are impassable and CoGrid environments must be rectangular and enclosed by walls.
#
# Importantly, we don't specify spawn positions in the environment below. However, if you'd
# like to be able to dictate the exact positions that agents will spawn (e.g., particularly
# in layouts with clear spacial delineations), you can use the "+" character. This will
# randomize agent spawn positions at +'s. In the definition below, spawns are simply selected
# randomly from empty spaces.

    # We have two different ways to represent actions in CoGrid.
    # Both have common actions of No-Op, Toggle, and Pickup/Drop.
    # "cardinal_actions" is the default and uses the 4 cardinal directions
    # to move (e.g., move up, down, left, right). This is intuitive for
    # human players, where pressing the right arrow moves you right. There
    # is also "rotation_actions", which only uses forward movement and two
    # rotation actions (e.g., rotate left, rotate right). This is in line
    # with the original Minigrid environments.

    # on how you could add alternative reward functions. For
